Describe the results achieved through your research process.
Conclusion
The “EasyApps” software engineers provided their customers,  business analysts of “Structured Mechanics Enterprises”,  the_______________ Prompt Requirements Analysis tool.
Feedback from the business analysts was________________
The more Questions and Answers provided through the PROMP pipeline the more refined the answers from the Prompt Engineering Tool. The Took continues to drill to more answers about your Q and A.

# Further research

Describe what we could do next and propose new ideas for further research.
Allow user input to gather information from at least one person from each user group. The more input we have about how the user would like to use the system, the more behavior we can add. Humans actually supply the information; AI supplies assistance in the form of refined information to help build our product.
